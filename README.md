Virutal Cookbook

by Danielle Colbert

In this project, I created an application where users register an account so that they can save recipes to their virtual cookbook.

To run this application, please create a database called 'new_data_flask'. To run the project, make sure you have the following modules and requirements downloaded: requests, json, unittest, os, flask, flask_script, flask_wtf, wtforms, sqhalchemy, flask_sqlalchemy, flask_migrate, flask_mail, threading, werkzeug, and flask_login.

Once you have all the requirements installed, you can run the application by typing 'python food2fork.py runserver' in terminal.

Please go to localhost:5000/ to sign in. Once you click sign in, you are taken to a login in screen where you can register a new account. An email will be sent when registation is complete. 

After logging in, you can search for recipes to add to your virtual cookbook.

To run the tests, type 'python test.py' in terminal.

Enjoy!
